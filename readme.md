**Magic Collection** adds powerful features to Laravel Eloquent collections.  
It lets you call relationships directly on a collection of models, and includes an Artisan command to generate custom collection classes.

## ‚ú® Features

- Call relationships on a collection of models:  
  Example: `$users->blogs` (where $user is a collection)
- Automatically merges related results using `flatMap`
- Safe handling of empty collections
- Define custom collection classes per model
- Artisan command to generate collections: `php artisan make:collection`

---
## Installation

Via Composer

```bash
composer require winavin/magic-collection
```

## Usage

1. **Use the Trait on your models**
```php
use Winavin\Collections\UsesMagicCollections;

class User extends Model
{
    use UsesMagicCollections;
}
```
2. **(Optional) Create a custom collection for a model**

```php artisan make:collection```

This command creates a collection class in the App\Collections folder.
It will automatically extend the base collection and follow naming rules.

If the collection name matches your model name and path (like UserCollection for User Model), it will be used automatically.

But if you want to manually set it, you can do that in your model:
```php
class User extends Model
{
...
    protected function useCollection(): string
    {
        return MyCustomUserCollection::class;
    }
```

Absolutely! Here's a **"Known Errors"** section in proper Markdown format for your `README.md`, including clear steps to resolve trait method collisions (like the one with `newCollection()`):

---

## üêû Known Errors

### ‚ùå Trait method collision: `newCollection()`

You may see this error if you're using another trait or package (like `HasRecursiveRelationships`) that also defines a `newCollection()` method:

```
Trait method Winavin\MagicCollection\Traits\UsesMagicCollections::newCollection has not been applied as App\Models\YourModel::newCollection, because of collision with Other Trait's newCollection method.
```

---

### ‚úÖ How to Fix It

If your model needs to use both `MagicCollection` and another custom collection (like one from another package), follow these steps:

---

#### 1. Generate a Custom Collection

```bash
php artisan make:collection YourModelCollection
```

This creates `App\Collections\YourModelCollection`.

---

#### 2. Change the Collection's Base Class

In your new collection file, replace:

```php
use Winavin\MagicCollection\Collections\BaseCollection;

class YourModelCollection extends BaseCollection
```

**with the class from the conflicting package**, for example:

```php
use Staudenmeir\LaravelAdjacencyList\Eloquent\Collection as AdjacencyCollection;
use Winavin\MagicCollection\Collections\Trait\BaseCollectionTrait;

class YourModelCollection extends AdjacencyCollection
{
    use BaseCollectionTrait;

    // MagicCollection features + AdjacencyCollection features
}
```

---

#### 3. Define `newCollection()` in Your Model

In your model (e.g., `App\Models\YourModel`), override the method:

```php
public function newCollection(array $models = [])
{
    return new \App\Collections\YourModelCollection($models);
}
```

This tells Laravel to use your custom collection with both features.

---

### üß† Notes

- If you don‚Äôt need both, you can just prefer one trait using `insteadof`.
- This solution gives you full control while keeping both functionalities working together.
